Basic XBee Example
===
Simple program that monitors the serial port for an ON or OFF command and then turns the onboard LED on or off based on the command received from the XBee.  You need to have another program to send the command.  For testing purposes you can simply use a terminal like X-CTU and connect one of the XBees to your computers usb port.
